## Introduction

Welcome to OurQuest, an innovative goal-setting and achievement tracking platform inspired by Reddit's engaging community concept. With OurQuest, we aim to transform the way people set, share, and achieve their goals. 

OurQuest is more than just a goal tracker. It's a community where users can create and participate in "Quests," which symbolize goals. They can share these quests with others or keep them private, depending on their comfort level. Users can compete, collaborate, or simply use the platform as a personal diary of achievements. Each completed quest contributes to the user's achievement score, creating a fun, competitive, and engaging experience. 

## Features

- Create personalized Quests that represent your goals.
- Choose to make your Quests public or private.
- Collaborate with others on shared Quests.
- Compete with groups or individuals on achieving common goals.
- Earn achievement scores for each completed Quest.
